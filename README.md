# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
_The project is a C++ program that simulates a clock and allows users to input a time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It then displays the inputted time in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats. Users can also manipulate the time by adding hours, minutes, or seconds. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit._

# What did you do particularly well?
_I feel as if the program provides clear instructions and a user-friendly menu for interaction. I also had a big hiccup but in the end i made the program accurately handle time manipulation, accounting for 24-hour and 12-hour formats._

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
_2 things i could enhance is the lack of extensive error handling. Implementing validation checks for user inputs could enhance its robustness. The code could be more modular. Breaking down functionalities into separate functions can improve readability and maintainability._

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
_Going back into zybooks getting a hold of basics and trying out the challenging activites again helped me immensely. The most difficult part was getting the 24 hour clock._

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
_This project required me breaking down a complex problem into manageable parts. What is really important i would think is creating a user-friendly interface demonstrates an understanding of user experience design principles._

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
_Some small key things i did to make it all easier to digest is using descriptive variable names that made the code self-explanatory, aiding readability. Maintaining consistent code formatting, such as indentation and spacing, contributes to readability also._

_By addressing these areas of improvement, the code can become more efficient, secure, and maintainable, ensuring its adaptability for future modifications and enhancements._
